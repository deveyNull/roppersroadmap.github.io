Assuming knowledge ofGDB, Ghidra, and basic Exploitation:

## Firmware RE

    * BuildRoot Tutorial
    * Cross Compile Buildchain
    * QEMU
    * Other SDKs and Buildchains
2. Static Triage
   * Identifying an unknown firmware architecture
   * Identifying interesting functions and parsers 
3. Get to Rootfs
   * <https://www.makemehack.com/2020/04/how-to-get-the-root-file-system.html> 
   * Binwalk + Custom Toolchains

   * Inittab/init.d
   * Identify interesting services
5. Kernel
   * VMLinux to Elf 
6. Ghidra	
   * Eclipse IDE - Ghidra Scripts, Ghidra-Dev Plugin
7. Dynamic Triage
   * Architectures
       * Bug Types in Each
    * GDB Multi-Arch
    * Get things to work/TroubleShoot
8. RTOS
